# ny_propery_sales
This project ensures a comprehensive analysis, from data cleaning to actionable insights, suitable for stakeholders in real estate or urban planning.
Project Definition and Goals:

First, we need to define what we want to achieve with this analysis.  
Let's say we want to understand:

Trends in property sales prices: Are prices rising or falling in different areas of NYC?
Factors influencing sales prices: What characteristics (e.g., size, location, building type) correlate with price?
Identify potential outliers: Are there any unusually high or low sales prices that warrant further investigation?

Data Acquisition and Exploration

Obtain the dataset
This dataset on Kaggle or NYC Open Data. Download it in a format like CSV.
Load the data: 
Use a tool like Python with the Pandas library to load the CSV file into a data structure called a DataFrame. 
This DataFrame will allow you to easily manipulate and analyze the data. Example (conceptual Python):

Project Flow

Clean Data: Remove duplicates, fix missing values, and filter outliers.

Explore: Calculate average prices by borough, visualize trends.
